Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
==============================

This is the TLDR summary of two courses on Data Structures and Algorithms. I
summarized everything I learned from these materials.  
  
Iâ€™ve included the code for each concept in Python. I would suggest to implement
this short code for your projects.

I highly recommend the following materials:

[Udacity nano degree: Data Structures and
Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256)

[Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (The MIT Press)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)
=====================================================================================================================================

[University of Central Florida Course: DESIGN & ANALYSIS ALGORITHMS 2019](

Udacity nano degree notes for job interview

CLRS book for more in depth

UCF course for solving different challenges

Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree Program from Udacity A repository for
notes and projects

Course Objectives: Understanding of various types of techniques for algorithms
design and (run time) analysis in detail. Also, a gentle introduction to several
advanced data structures.

Course Overview: Review of mathematical background, sorting and searching,
algorithm design techniques such as divide and conquer, greedy approach, dynamic
programming, worst case and average case analysis techniques, data structures
such as binary search trees and various heaps, graph algorithms, string
algorithms and geometric data structures, advanced topics (P, NP, NP-Complete,
etc) if time permits.
