UCF Courses: DESIGN & ANALYSIS ALGORITHMS [Fall 2019]

Course Objectives: Understanding of various types of  techniques for algorithms design and (run time) analysis in detail. Also, a gentle introduction to several advanced data structures. 

Course Overview:  Review of mathematical background, sorting and searching, algorithm design techniques such as divide and conquer, greedy approach, dynamic programming, worst case and average case analysis techniques, data structures such as binary search trees and various heaps, graph algorithms, string algorithms and geometric data structures, advanced topics (P, NP, NP-Complete, etc) if time permits.
